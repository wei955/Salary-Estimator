Data Scientist,CA$77k-CA$95k (Glassdoor Est.),"Our Purpose:

We want to create a world served by exceptional professionals, and we do that by helping academic institutions find holistically stronger applicants. We help them look beyond book smarts. Think of us like an “SAT” that evaluates who you are instead of what you know. Our main assessment, the CASPer test, is used widely for high stakes admissions to Healthcare Training, Teachers Education and other academic programs in Canada, the US and as far away as Australia. To date, we have had over 300 000 people take the CASPer test including 80% of all US and Canadian Medical School applicants.

Who We Are:

We are a group of ~60 individuals collaboratively to tackle some tough problems (like how to evaluate empathy in someone who wants to become a doctor), and some less tough ones (like what to bring in for the communal snack table).

Our core values are caring, curious, and driven, and we embody these values in everything that we do. We genuinely care about the well-being of others, we possess an innate desire to continuously learn, and every day we strive to be better than the professional we were the day before.

You can get to know some of us on our People of Altus blog!

Who Would Fit In:

People who do well here are caring, humble, prefer change over the status-quo, are comfortable with “fuzzy” (vs. well defined) tasks, and are eager to solve problems. We all have a healthy appetite for learning and love to share our knowledge with our co-workers. We want people who put “we before me”.

The Role:

As a growing company, we strive to empower our team in making data-driven decisions by discovering valuable insights in the data we gather. Your primary focus will be in automating processes for teams to have immediate access to data, building data pipelines to create a powerful analytics database and working on various machine learning projects which strengthen the quality of our product. To date we have had over 300,000 people take the CASPer test and as a result have amassed a wealth of powerful data.

We are looking to add another Data Scientist to our team. You will be one of two Data Scientists working in the company reporting into the Director of Product.

In 12 Months:
You have immersed yourself in all things Altus, have learned our business, all the data we collect, its format, and have undertaken processing of structured and unstructured data.
You have created data pipelines from a NoSQL database to analyze results for various stakeholders and proposed solutions and strategies to business challenges.
You have created dashboards to help with business intelligence and analytics for other teams within the company having identified, analyzed, and interpreted trends or patterns in complex data sets using statistical techniques, and presented information using data visualization techniques to provide ongoing reports.
You have helped build predictive models and machine-learning algorithms and automated tasks within the company to help deliver results and evolve our processes
You have earned the respect of the Altus team for your endless curiosity and creative problem-solving when sharing data insights and results.
You are working with our Product team to prioritize business and information needs while locating and defining new process improvement opportunities for our Operations team
You are known for your problem solving skills and speed of execution and will always be looking for creative ways to accelerate our data processes and have earned the trust of your peers for your deep insights on how we might make improvements to our processes and support the growth and development of our company.
You are known as a leader on the data science team, executing on the vision, delivering results and sharing data insights that will help your teammates understand our business and customers better.
Having taken ownership, you are known as a significant “values fit” and ""culture add"" that is helping us build towards the type of “people first” high-performance company we want to be.

The intention of the Life Story interview is to construct your own personal timeline, including decisions you’ve made, what you’re passionate about, and the path you’ve taken to bring you to where you are today.

2. After the Life Story, successful candidates will be invited to a 60 minute technical interview with 2 Shopify developers. You will be informed in advance of the interview of what you need to bring. Generally, we ask that candidates bring a project with them they can present to our interviewers, specifically something that includes code they have written personally (ideally not a group project). In the event that candidates don’t have a project, then we ask that they complete a coding challenge before the technical interview. The second half of the interview is a collaborative problem solving exercise with our developers.

3. After the technical interview, successful candidates are placed on teams based on their interests, skills and experience. Each placement is done individually and with significant consideration.

*Timelines of decision-making will be clearly communicated to candidates by their Recruiter throughout the process and you will always hear back from us #noghosting. If you haven't received an update from us after the posting closes, check your junk mail!

We’re not saying this involves beers, guitars, and songs by the campfire. But we’re not saying it doesn’t.

We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. We work hard while still having fun, being ourselves, hanging out together, and enjoying delicious snacks at the office.

And we don’t just support each other in the office. The number of musicians in-house is pretty overwhelming, from 90s cover bands to death metal. There’s always a co-worker with a gig coming up and we love to go out and cheer them on.

At Coveo, it is our constant obsession to find out innovative ways to put our customer's data to work for them. Luckily for us, said customers are pouring in an ever increasing volume of that primordial data which allows our teams to have a lot of material to work with. But all that data is difficult to collect and even more challenging to make sense of without the right data platform. And that is where you come in as a premier data engineer!

What a typical day looks like:
You start your day with a good coffee, reading news about some new stream processing library Netflix has recently released to enable more efficient pipelines. You take a few notes to discuss with your colleagues at the scrum.
After the scrum, you get to work with the In-Product experience team to define the data format and implement a new data pipeline to gather, analyse and learn from all interactions happening in their clients applications. Based on the client's metrics, you estimate the load at several millions of events daily, so you work hard on optimizing and load testing the new data pipeline.
You get to chat with Mike as you go fill your water bottle: the data pipeline you've set for the ML team a month ago really made the data scientists' lives easier. High-fives all around for that!
You get to lunch, and the team wanted to watch the streaming of a presentation of a new AWS feature coming up that might provide new options to scale our platform.
Back to your desk (or some other location) to continue working on the development of the new in-product experience data pipeline using the latest streaming and data processing technologies.
You show your design, submit your code and the results of the tests for review by your colleagues. Great work: the new pipeline can transform hundreds of millions of events daily in real-time without problems.
A new big client is being on boarded by the Commerce team, and they would like to make sure that all the events have been integrated properly. You take a look at what happens under the hood to make sure everything is flawless!
A member of the Usage Analytics team has a question about the dataset she wants to extract and more specifically how to get the right columns for an analysis she is working on. You take a quick 10 min to discuss with her, and then get back to your code.
What is expected of you:
As a Data Engineer at Coveo, we'll encourage you to innovate, and share ideas on a daily basis. We are looking for candidates with at least 3 years of working experience. Some of the core expertise we're looking for:
Extensive knowledge of SQL.
Experience with Kafka, Kinesis or other streaming platforms.
Experience in Data Lake Architecture, and high volume real-time streaming.
Experience in distributed computing and big data.
Knowledge of data warehouses like Redshift or Snowflake.
